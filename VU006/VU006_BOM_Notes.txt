Note about 2.54mm headers : listed here are 1x2 and 1x8 headers, cheaper to get this Mouser ref 61304011121 and break it appart. Alternatively, Tayda provide 40pin headers for quite cheap

Note about 2.54mm stackables/sockets : 1x8 ref listed here just fit in the width of the board (20mm), though Tayda ones (21mm) can be used as long as the extra mm is sanded.
Probably worth getting a few extra as sanding can fragilize the connector a bit. 1x2 socket can be the one listed or Tayda, no modification needed.

Note about spacers: if using the Mouser refs for socket/stackable, spacers needs to be 11mm MF/12mm FF. For Tayda ref, 11mm FF/11mm MF

Note about C1->C6 capacitors: those capacitors sets the timing of the oscillator, if using ceramic capacitors, ensure that they're C0G dieletric, else it might not oscillate at all.
For bigger values, film capacitors can be used.
